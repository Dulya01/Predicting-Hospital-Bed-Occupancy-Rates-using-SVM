# Predicting-Hospital-Bed-Occupancy-Rates-using-SVM

Hospital bed occupancy rates are crucial indicators of healthcare system efficiency and resource management. Accurately predicting these rates enables hospital administrators to manage admissions, staffing, and resource allocation effectively. However, traditional methods often fail to address the complexity and nonlinearity inherent in healthcare operations data. Machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVMs), offer robust predictive capabilities, making them suitable for this application.
